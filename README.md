# VBA-challenge - The VBA of Wall Street

<b>BACKGROUND</b><br>

The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive tasks that run over and over again with a click of a button!

<b>VBA scripting is used to analyze real stock market data.</b></div>

<br>

<b>DETAILS</b><br>
A script was created to loop through one year of stock data and output the following information:<br>

  - The ticker symbol.
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - Percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - Total stock volume of the stock.

Conditional formatting was used to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

<br>
<b>ADVANCED CHALLENGES</b><br>
Script was also written to run on every worksheet (i.e., every year) and return the stock with the following:<br><br>

  - "Greatest % increase"
  - "Greatest % decrease"
  - "Greatest total volume" 
<br>
This script acts the same on each sheet.
