<b>BACKGROUND</b><br>

<b>VBA scripting is used to analyze real stock market data.</b></div>

<br>

<b>DETAILS</b><br>
A script was created to loop through one year of stock data and output the following information.<br>

  - The ticker symbol.
  - Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.

Conditional formatting was used to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

<br>
<b>ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES</b><br>
The script acts the same on each sheet. Script was written to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once and return the stock with<br>
  - "Greatest % increase"
  - "Greatest % decrease"
  - "Greatest total volume"
