# VBA-challenge - The VBA of Wall Street

Background<br>
VBA scripting was used to analyze real stock market data

DETAILS<br>

A script was created to loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

The ticker symbol.
Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock.

Conditional formatting was used to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES INCLUDED<br>

Script to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once and return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume" 

The script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button!
